### What I learned

Learned how to create a design system while building a Space Travel Website.

### Continued development

Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of accessible UI design and responsive layouts. I learned how to use ARIA attributes to improve screen reader support for interactive elements, and how to manage focus states for better keyboard navigation.
I also practiced using CSS custom properties for theming and maintaining consistent styles.
